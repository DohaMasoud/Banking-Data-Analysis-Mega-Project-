📊 Key Insights (Loan Analysis)

Total Loans: 2,500 (~$617M disbursed).

Active Loans: 99.4% still active.

53% of loans show no transactions in the past 6 months.

27% of loan customers don’t have a bank account or card.

Loan disbursements peak in March, June, and October.

Loan maturities cluster in Feb, Mar, Jul, Aug, Sep → need more staff support.

Top 5 loan holders control a large share of the loan portfolio.

⚠️ Problems Identified

High share of inactive loan accounts.

Low cross-product adoption (loans without accounts/cards).

Seasonal peaks in loan disbursements and maturities → risk of resource overload.

✅ Recommendations

Bundle products (loans + accounts/cards) with incentives.

Targeted engagement: SMS/email reminders for loan activity & due dates.

Seasonal resource planning: hire/allocate more staff in peak months.

Risk monitoring for top loan holders to ensure repayment stability.
